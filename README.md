# Habit Tracker
I created an app where the user can add new habits and mark whether they have performed them each day📊⏰🔥

The app should have the following features:

Pass:

• A list of all the habits the user has added.✅

• Ability to add new habits by entering the name of the habit.✅


• Ability to mark whether a habit has been performed each day by clicking a button next to the habit's name.✅

• Storage of how long a "streak" is for each habit, i.e., how many consecutive days the habit has been performed.✅



Distinction:

• A compilation of the user's performed habits for each day, week, and month.✅

• Ability to set reminders for each habit, so that the user receives a reminder to perform the habit at a specific time each day.✅

First pic: In home page can you add new habits that you want to keep track of using the plus sign. You can also edit the name, change the color, or delete one with the edit button. You can also keep track of how many habits you have completed in a row with the fire emoji.

Third pic: In the calendar, you need first to select which habit you want to track for the entire month and also set a reminder so that you don't forget to do it.
