# Habit Tracker
I created an app where the user can add new habits and mark whether they have performed them each day📊⏰🔥

The app should have the following features:

Pass:

• A list of all the habits the user has added.✅

• Ability to add new habits by entering the name of the habit.✅


• Ability to mark whether a habit has been performed each day by clicking a button next to the habit's name.✅

• Storage of how long a "streak" is for each habit, i.e., how many consecutive days the habit has been performed.✅



Distinction:

• A compilation of the user's performed habits for each day, week, and month.✅

• Ability to set reminders for each habit, so that the user receives a reminder to perform the habit at a specific time each day.✅
