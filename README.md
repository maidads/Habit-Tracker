# Habit Tracker
I created an app where the user can add new habits and mark whether they have performed them each day📊⏰🔥

The app should have the following features:

Pass:

• A list of all the habits the user has added.✅

• Ability to add new habits by entering the name of the habit.✅


• Ability to mark whether a habit has been performed each day by clicking a button next to the habit's name.✅

• Storage of how long a "streak" is for each habit, i.e., how many consecutive days the habit has been performed.✅



Distinction:

• A compilation of the user's performed habits for each day, week, and month.✅

• Ability to set reminders for each habit, so that the user receives a reminder to perform the habit at a specific time each day.✅

In first picture, in home page you can add new habits that you want to keep track of using the plus sign. You can also edit the name, change the color, or delete one with the edit button. You can also keep track of how many habits you have completed in a row with the fire emoji.

On the left, this is how it looks when you push the plus sign and want to add a new habit. On the right is how it looks when you want to edit a habit. You can also set a reminder so that you don't forget to do it.

Lastly, in the calendar, you need first to select which habit you want to track for the entire month. Then you will get for example the calendar for training.
